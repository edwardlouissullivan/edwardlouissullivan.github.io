        <h2>Hi, I'm Ed.</h2>  
        <h4 class="text-muted">
I grew up in Gaithersburg, Maryland, a suburb of DC, did my undergrad at Clemson University in  Computer Engineering, and then my master's in Computer Science from UC San Diego.  Right now, I'm working with an awesome team of engineers at Lexumo, a startup in Cambridge, MA that's pioneering a new technology to secure open-source code.
<br><br>
When I'm not at my computer, I love to get outside and soak up that vitamin D. My hobbies include mountain biking, ultimate frisbee, traveling, flag football, taking advantage of Taco Tuesday, seeing live music, and spending time with friends.<br><br>

To learn more about me, check out my stories below. You can also find my contact information  in the links below.

          <p>Currently I work for <a href="https://Lexumo.com">Lexumo</a>, a computer-security startup based in Cambridge, MA.  We apply innovative techniques to  help other companies use open-source libraries safely.  Without ever looking at our customers' source code, we can detect which open-source packages they're using, which versions of those packages they have, and whether their versions are vulnerable to any publically disclosed security vulnerabilities, including but not limited to CVEs. Furthermore, we can detect if a customer has already patched a particular security bug, so we have a low false positive rate. Finally, once we determine that a customer is vulnerable to a particular bug, we show they them the patch that they would use to fix the bug. I have served as a hybrid software developer and security analyst for Lexumo. Check us out!</p>

          <p>In 2015, I finished my master's degree in computer science at <href="http://cryptosec.ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego</a> . Specifically, I focused on software engineering and security. As part of the <a href="http://aerosec.org">Aerosec</a> research team, I helped reverse engineer and analyze <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~savage/papers/CCS14MobileCockpit.pdf">"The Security of Mobile Cockpit Information Systems"</a> used for navigation in airplanes. For my research exam, I surveyed the most recent literature related to static decompilation. Check it out <a href="docs/edward_sullivan_research_exam.pdf">here</a>! My other research involved entropy and random number generators. In my free time, I enjoyed competing in Capture The Flag competitions on UCSD's team (<a href="https://ctftime.org/team/6473">SIGINT</a>), playing ultimate frisbee, surfing, and dominating <a href="images/flagFootball.jpg">intramural flag football</a>.</p>

          <p> At <a href="http://www.clemson.edu/">Clemson University</a> in South Carolina, I studied <a href="http://www.clemson.edu/ces/departments/ece/">computer engineering</a>. As a student in the <a href="http://www.clemson.edu/academics/programs/national-scholars/">Clemson National Scholars Program</a>, I travelled with my best friends through countries in Europe, Africa, and North America. My honors research with <a href="http://www.clemson.edu/ces/departments/ece/faculty_staff/faculty/rbrooks.html">Dr. Richard R. Brooks</a> involved "Avoiding Entropy-Based DDoS Detection." </p>
        <img src="images/cambridge2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image" style="width:100%">
          <p>After my freshman year in college, I studied abroad at the <a href="http://www.ice.cam.ac.uk/courses/summer-schools">Cambridge University International Summer School</a>. My favorite course that summer, and one of the most interesting courses I have ever taken, was a "History of the Scientific Revolution," taught by <a href="https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~piers/">Piers Bursill-Hall</a>.</p>

          <p>I've always preferred being outside in nature, so for high school, I applied to join the <a href="http://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/schools/poolesvillehs/magnet/globalecology/"> Global Ecology Studies Program</a> at Poolesville High School in Maryland. This four-year curriculum replaced traditional classes in the physical and social sciences with environmentally-themed counterparts. We went on field trips to riparian buffer zones, wind farms, old growth forests, recycling centers, trash incinerators, the Chesapeake Bay, water filtration centers, artificial whitewater centers, dams, the Capitol, historic sites, and more.</p>

          <p>As a major proponent of environmental stewardship, I was thrilled to intern at the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/sustainability-base/">NASA Ames Sustainability Base</a> in Mountain View, California for the summer of 2012. The Sustainability Base is a state-of-the-art LEED Platinum building that serves as a testbed for NASA-designed green technologies. Specifically, my project involved deploying a network of  wireless sensors to measure temperature, light, and humidity so as to aid in the development of an integrated control system involving several software-controlled subsystems including HVAC, shades, windows, lights, and more. </p>

          <p>While interning in the <a href="http://vlsida.soe.ucsc.edu/">VLSI Design Automation Lab at UC Santa Cruz</a> in the summer of 2011, I worked with <a href="http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~mrg/">Dr. Matthew Guthaus</a> to research methods for reducing the power consumption of local resonant clock trees. I also had time for some world-class mountain biking in the sublime redwood forests adjacent to campus.</p>
        <img src="images/nih2.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" alt="Responsive image" style="width:100%">
          <p>During high school, I interned for a year at the <a href="http://www.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health</a> in Bethesda, Maryland. I assisted my mentor, <a href="http://www.iit.it/en/people/francesco-papaleo.html">Dr. Francesco Papaleo</a>, in designing and executing several in vivo experiments intended to determine the impact of specific gene modifications on anti-social behavior in mice. Our ultimate goal was to pinpoint which genes contribute to schizophrenia. </p>

          <p>Since music is one of my passions, I became a DJ at <a href="http://wsbf.net/listen">WSBF-FM Clemson 88.1</a>, a student-run radio station also known as "Wizbif." I hosted a weekly 2-hour show called “The Ed Sullivan Show” geared toward introducing listeners to new artists who had not yet reached the Top-40. Later, I took on the job of chief computer engineer for the station, in charge of managing the website, the music streaming, the song archives, and the back-end infrastructure.

          <p>I love traveling! Through the generosity of the <a href="https://www.ciee.org/study-abroad/scholarships-grants/"> CIEE South Korea Scholarship Program</a>, I explored Seoul for 10 days during my 2010 spring break. I even stepped foot (very briefly) in North Korea while touring the DMZ! With the help of the <a href="http://www.clemson.edu/academics/programs/national-scholars/"> Clemson National Scholars Program</a>, I later visited Italy, France, England, South Africa, Quebec and Newfoundland. </p>

          <p>The Washington, DC area has some of the best urban whitewater kayaking in the world, just a few minutes away from my family's home in Maryland. Here my younger brother (the bigger one) and I are gearing up to join our mother on the Potomac River at Violette's Lock.</p>
